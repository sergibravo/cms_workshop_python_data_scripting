## Computational Molecular Science (CMS) Workshop - Python scripting

This repo contains a series of mini projects done as part of the CMS Workshop, available at https://education.molssi.org/python_scripting_cms 

The subproject include:
1) Parsing files: Total energies from .out files into a separate .txt file; and plotting the values into a .png.
2) Data plotting using numpy+matplotlib.
3) Calculating distances in-between atoms of .xyz files.
4) Testing code.
5) Version control (git and GitHub).
